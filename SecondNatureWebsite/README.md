## The Second Nature Project

* The Second Nature Project is a smartphone donation program, whereby consumers can donate their old smartphone to be transformed into wildlife observation cameras. Donated smartphones will be wiped clean of user data, equipped with a motion sensing camera application, and deployed into the wild under the supervision of wildlife researchers. When the smartphones take a picture the files are made publicly available to consumer who has donated the phone, thus engaging the consumer in the work of the wildlife researchers, while addressing the growing issue of post consumer e-waste.
